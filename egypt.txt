Ancient Egypt was an ancient civilization of eastern North Africa, concentrated along the lower reaches of the Nile River.
The civilization coalesced around 3150 BC with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under the first pharaoh.
Ancient Egypt reached its pinnacle during the New Kingdom, after which it entered a period of slow decline.
